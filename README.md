# MILK a simple 3D landing page made with ThreeJS.
P̳r̳o̳j̳e̳c̳t̳ ̳I̳n̳f̳o̳r̳m̳a̳t̳i̳o̳n̳:<br>
It is a personal project which I did to learn the threejs library and develop 3d pages.<br>
It is a fairly simple website that pretends to be an ecommerce store.<br>
The website and the milk carton model were created by me, so feel free to use them for anything.<br>
